Hi! My name is Parker Glenn. I'm a Data Scientist exploring all things language & tech. I'm currently very interested in methods combining symbolic reasoning with LLMs, constrained decoding, and database systems.

## What's New

- (October 2024) I've started a new role as Principal Data Scientist @ Capital One
- (May 2024) [BlendSQL: A Scalable Dialect for Unifying Hybrid Question Answering in Relational Algebra](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.25/) was accepted to 2024 ACL findings

## Projects

### [BlendSQL](https://github.com/parkervg/blendsql)
Query language for blending SQL and LLMs across structured + unstructured data, with type constraints.

### [BillLit ðŸ”¥](https://billlit.com/)
A React web app I made with my friends to help you split the bill at restaurants.

### [Grammar Guide](https://github.com/parkervg/grammar-guide)
Speculative grammar backtracking for LLM decoding conforming to some [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) context-free grammar (CFG).
